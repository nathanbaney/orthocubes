# orthocubes

/* HINDSIGHT OVERVIEW / RESUME INFORMATION

Gosh, I really don't like Unity. Maybe I just don't understand the pipeline that the engine likes, but
everything just felt like pulling teeth trying to prototype with purely code-based object generation.
Even so, this was a case of another pie-in-the-sky project that didn't see fruition, but had some interesting
problem-solving aspects. I remember one being the data structure for each "chunk" of cubes, and computing
the values for the rotation of those chunks. Plus trying to implement WaveFormCollapse, which was a 
nightmare, and never really ended up working for me 100%. Still ended up having some neat geometric
output though.

orthogonal cubes. eventually a game...maybe
